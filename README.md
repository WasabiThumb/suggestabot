# suggestabot
A discord bot made for a little fun
\
\
When downloading a release, you more than likely want the one ending in -all. This includes all dependencies required to use the bot.\
The bot expects the bot token to be used as the first argument. For example,

     java -Xms1G -jar SuggestBot-<VERSION>-all.jar <TOKEN>
